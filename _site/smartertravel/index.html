	<h1>Smarter Travel Limerick - Research</h1>

</div>

<div class="page_content">

	<div class="wrapper">
		<p><span class="eta"></span> (<span class="words"></span> words)</p>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>
			This group research project was given to my classmates and I to test our primary research techniques. We had to understand a system as it is now and through a process of analysis and synthesis design a guide to improve the system. The focus of the project was to uncover both issumes and needs for the mechanic and the user.
		</p>
		<p>
			This project was in collaboration with entrepreneur Gary Sheehan of Gary Sheehan Mobile Bike Repair and Smarter Travel Limerick. We found many ways to make Gary's process more efficent making this project a success.
		</p>

		<h2>Discover</h2>
		<p>
			To start off the research process we asked some important questions which allowed us to get a base understanding of what we knew about the companies in question.
		</p>
		<h3>What is Limerick Smarter Travel?</h3>
		<p>
			Limerick Smarter Travel works with schools, campuses, workplaces and communities to help them change their travel habits, cut their car usage and increase active travel. Limerick is Ireland’s Smarter Travel demonstration city so changes made here could easily affect the whole country.
		</p>
		<h3>What do they do on the UL campus?</h3>
		<p>
			University campuses are generally viewed as positive environments for the application of travel change initiatives. In UL this no different. They run a free Bike Mechanic service which all students and lecturers can use. They also run a Bike Hub which is a secure location for bikes to be kept and can only be accessed by students and lecturers which have registered
		</p>
		<h3>Who is Gary Sheehan?</h3>
		<p>
			Gary Sheehan is the UL Bike Mechanic. He has 16 years of experience in the biking industry. He has worked on everyday bikes to professional cycling teams in Europe and Asia. Currently he runs his own mobile bike repair service under the moniker “Gary Sheehan Mobile Bike Repair”.
		</p>
		<h3>What does he do?</h3>
		<p>
			Gary Sheehan is paid by Limerick Smarter Travel to work on student and lecturers bikes in the Student Courtyard in UL. Here he repairs and offers advice bikes for free. The only cost to the user in this situation is for spare parts which are subsidised by Limerick Smarter Travel.
		</p>
		<h3>When does he work?</h3>
		<p>
			Gary Sheehan operates every Tuesday during term between the times of 10:30 to 16:30. Here is part of the Farmer’s Market which operates at the same times each week.
		</p>
		<h3>What are the prices of replacements?</h3>

		<h2>Task Flows</h2>
		<p>
			Task flows of both the users and the fixes allows us to pinpoint inefficiencies which can both speed up the process while alleviating problems that may arise.
		</p>
		<img src="/smartertravel/img/user-task.png" alt="" />
		<p>
			Users should have something to do while they wait so that the time waiting doesn't seem as long.
		</p>

		<p>
			We looked at 3 common problems and how they are fixed. The 3 problems were picked by the occurance in our field research.

		<h2>Mind Mapping</h2>
		<p>
			After 2 weeks of researching the bike doctor a lot of information was gathered from raw data and observations this data needed to be displayed visually to allow us, as researchers find the research that will help us generate ideas and improve the service. Over the next couple of pages a break down of each section of this mind map is available.
		</p>
		<img src="/smartertravel/img/mindmap.png" alt="" />
		<img src="/smartertravel/img/mindmap-1.png" alt="" />
		<p>
			The location of the Bike Doctor is an important section of research. While the Bike Doctor is in the student courtyard during the farmers market, finding the gazebo can be difficult to find because of the lack of advertising. The Bike Doctor is hidden in clear sight. The farmer’s market is also a food market and has high foot traffic. The only bikes that go through the market are coming to the bike doctor. The gazebo is also exposed to the weather and has very little cover.
		</p>
		<img src="/smartertravel/img/mindmap-3.png" alt="" />
		<p>
			 Gary only uses a couple of tools very regularly. These include the tyre levers, hand pump and allen keys. The table on which the toolbox is only big enough to hold the toolbox and not any tools which might be needed. This toolbox is also very unorganised and tools are simply thrown into the box.
		</p>
		<img src="/smartertravel/img/mindmap-4.png" alt="" />
		<p>
			The setup for Gary is very simple. His gazebo is 3m x 3m and is open to horizontal rain because of it’s lack of sides. He has 2 storage boxes to hold multiple spare parts. These parts include brake cables, gears, pedals, tubes, brake pads and tools. He keeps more expensive parts in his van. He also has no cashbox and can be seen taking 100s of euros out of his pocket at any one time. He also has to twist his body to get at any tools he has in his toolbox this is not good for his back long term.
		</p>
		<img src="/smartertravel/img/mindmap-5.png" alt="" />
		<p>
			Setting up of the gazebo needs 3-4 people because it needs to be pulled apart from each corner. This gazebo is kept in a room in the Main Building on Campus along with the table which provides free merchandise.
		</p>
		<p>
			All other parts of the setup are kept in Gary’s van. These parts all need to be brought out before Gary can start work. Some Mornings there will be people in line before Gary sets up.
		</p>
		<img src="/smartertravel/img/mindmap-6.png" alt="" />
		<p>
			Users have to wait for Gary to be ready for them. Most of these users are students with the majority of students being Erasmus students how have rented these bikes. This means their bikes are more than likely older and needing more attention.
		</p>
		<p>
			The lack of shelter for the users means that users could decide to leave in bad weather. This data is obvious when comparing bad weather days to good.
		</p>
		<p>
			The long waits could also mean students miss lectures which could result in worse results for students at the end of the semester.
		</p>
		<img src="/smartertravel/img/mindmap-7.png" alt="" />
		<p>
			Gary Sheehan is open to the elements all day when working in UL. The job is also very messy and with no nearby cleaning station his hands stay greasy for the entire day.
		</p>
		<p>
			He also gives advice and is always polite and helpful to any customer that comes to help.
		</p>
		<p>
			The repetition of certain tasks all day long means that Gary has a high possibility of musculoskeletal disorders in later life.
		</p>

	<h2>Analysis</h2>
	<p>
		Analysis is needed to display the raw data discovered and organise it into actual usable information. This is done by writing out observation, problems and needs. These allow for idea generation to have an easy guide to look at
	</p>
	<p>
		An important part of this is creating an observation, problem, need table. This allows us to see all the problems with the service.

	<h2>Refinement</h2>
	<p>
		After coming up with a list of ideas, we picked a couple out a refined them into workable concepts.
	</p>
	<h3>The Toolbox</h3>
	<p>
		The toolbox was a pinch point for Gary where he would have to search for tools in the mess where he had previously thrown them in.
	</p>
	<img src="/smartertravel/img/sketch-1.png" />
	<img src="/smartertravel/img/sketch-2.png" alt="" />
	<p>
		The toolbox could be redesigned with different layers to hold different things and sections that come out and drawers.
	</p>
	<img src="/smartertravel/img/sketch-3.jpeg" alt="" />
	<p>
		We also thought about reorganising the toolbox with different drawers for different tools.
	</p>

	<p>
		A different layout is an important feature that needed to be addressed in Ideation. A redesigned layout both allows Gary to not have to twist and get strain injuries from going back at his toolbox. It also allows Gary to keep an eye on his expensive tools which could easily get stolen when he turns to fix a bike.
	</p>
	<img src="/smartertravel/img/sketch-4.jpeg" alt="" />
	<img src="/smartertravel/img/sketch-5.jpeg" alt="" />
	<img src="/smartertravel/img/sketch-6.jpeg" alt="" />
	<p>
		The current queuing system of the Bike Mechanic is there is none. A better organised queuing system will stop people getting in others ways as they walk through the courtyard. A more efficient method will save space and prevent accidents.
	</p>
	<img src="/smartertravel/img/sketch-7.jpeg" alt="" />
	<p>
		A Cash box will can also only benefit Gary with a cashbox he can keep his money in an organised manner and not in his pocket each denomination can have a separate section which will speed up money handling.
	</p>
	<img src="/smartertravel/img/sketch-8.jpeg" alt="" />
	<p>
		The ergonomics of hand tools are important for a job which requires a number of hand tools to use.
	</p>
	<p>
		Hand tool ergonomics is a well developed topic in the study of ergonomics, this means finding information on the subject is easy and solutions are quick to find.
	</p>
	<p>
		Below are several grip types each with pros and cons. These all have a force/precision trade off. This means that some grips are forceful and low precision while others have low power and high precision.
	</p>
	<img src="/smartertravel/img/ergo.png" alt="" />
	<p>
		The current hand pump that Gary uses is both too low for him and slow. This pump is used on most bikes during the day. Rising the hand pump up to hip height will save Gary’s back from pain and injury long term. Another solution could be a foot pump.
	</p>
	<img src="/smartertravel/img/sketch-9.jpeg" alt="" />
	<img src="/smartertravel/img/sketch-10.jpeg" alt="" />
	<p>
		Gary could also use a washing station so the grease and dirt doesn’t stick to his hands long term, which can lead to health concerns. Dissolving sugar in water is an industry hack for removing grease from hands and can easily be given to Gary to wash his hands.
	</p>
	<img src="/smartertravel/img/sketch-11.jpeg" alt="" />
	<p>
		Changing the shapes of handles of some of the tools and making them handheld and automatic can stop Gary from getting musculoskeletal disorders. A simple drill can speed up work while giving his hands a rest. Handles for tools were iterated with both models and sketches.
	</p>
	<img src="/smartertravel/img/sketch-12.jpeg" alt="" />
	<p>
		Simple handle iterations were looked at. These were designed after researching and looking at other examples of ergonomic handles. These sketches were used to generate ideas for models.
	</p>
	<img src="/smartertravel/img/sketch-13.png" alt="" />
	<img src="/smartertravel/img/sketch-14.png" alt="" />
	<img src="/smartertravel/img/sketch-15.png" alt="" />
	<p>
		An assistant idea was also looked at even though Gary said he would not like one we thought that he just disliked the implementation in his head. From talking to Gary we came to the conclusion that Gary does not want someone working on bikes with him. We decided that Gary could do with an assistant that helps with the Queuing system and very simple problems like pumping up tyres. Other systems were looked at such as a student workshop on campus and a bike repair flow chart.
	</p>
	<img src="/smartertravel/img/sketch-16.jpeg" alt="" />
	<p>
		During Ideation we also looked at moving the bike doctor to different locations around campus. Different locations offer different pros and cons. Red on the map is the current location and yellow is possible other destinations.
	</p>
	<img src="/smartertravel/img/location.png" alt="" />
	<br>
	<ul>
		<li>One of the possible locations was outside the paddocks restaurant across from the university visitor centre but this may block an emergency exit from stables</li>
		<li>Another option was along the gravel strip between the stables and the car park. This was a viable option but it is slightly out of the high traffic area and very open to the elements</li>
		<li>The third option is directly across from the entrance to the stable between the stables and the main building. This is a wide open space but is subject to harsh weather conditions</li>
		<li>A fourth option was around the bicycle racks beside the library. It was very much out of the way from a lot of foot traffic and the area was quite small and confined</li>
		<li>The final area was in front of the ski slopes beside the architects building. Although this area has high foot traffic and can easily be seen from a long way away, it is exposed to the elements especially wind and rain</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Concept Development</h2>
	<h3>Assistant</h3>
	<p>
		In this system firstly the users would queue with their bikes to see the assistant. Once the users reach the assistant their bike is diagnosed from this two scenarios may arise: 2a. The repair requires the mechanics attention and is tagged (with the repair needed and users name) and is placed on the entry bike rack, the assistant gives the user a repair time estimate allowing the user to leave and return later to pick up their bike. Also if payment is needed for the repair it is collected here 2b. The repair is very simple and the bike is repaired by the assistant allowing the user to leave with the bike.
The next step is for the mechanic to pick up the next bike off the rack and repair it.
Once the bike is repaired the mechanic can place it on the exit rack.
When the user returns, after the allotted time, to pick up their bike they must check it out from the assistant.
	</p>
	<img src="/smartertravel/img/sketch-17.jpeg" alt="" />
	<p>
		There is a lot of pros to this system. These include:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Allowing the Bike Mechanic to have a break</li>
		<li>Have the Queue regulated</li>
		<li>Have a set closing time</li>
		<li>Simple Problems get fixed simply and effectively</li>
		<li>Small Queue</li>
		<li>Money is collected and put away</li>
		<li>Student Volunteers get something to put on CV</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		The assistant needs bike racks to hold the bikes. These bike racks do not need to be put into the ground because the assistant will be there so they can be removed at the end of the day.
	</p>
	<img src="/smartertravel/img/sketch-18.jpeg" alt="" />
	<img src="/smartertravel/img/sketch-19.jpeg" alt="" />
	<img src="/smartertravel/img/sketch-20.jpeg" alt="" />

	<h3>Queuing System</h3>
	<p>
		Working on the queueing system required us to make models so decide which would solve the problem of the flow of people into the gazebo. In the current system we decided that the queuing system 2 would be the best but with our new improved design system 3 works best because of the smaller queues.
	</p>
	<div class="third">
		<img src="/smartertravel/img/qlayout-1.png" alt="" />
		<img src="/smartertravel/img/qlayout-2.png" alt="" />
		<img src="/smartertravel/img/qlayout-3.png" alt="" />
	</div>


	<h3>Layout</h3>
	<p>
		The layout of the gazebo is a idea that we spent a lot of time on. First we built a scale model of the gazebo and moved objects inside so we could get a grasp of the amount of space inside in the gazebo.
	</p>
	<div class="third">
		<img src="/smartertravel/img/layout-1.png" alt="" />
		<img src="/smartertravel/img/layout-2.png" alt="" />
		<img src="/smartertravel/img/layout-3.png" alt="" />
		<img src="/smartertravel/img/layout-4.png" alt="" />
		<img src="/smartertravel/img/layout-5.png" alt="" />
		<img src="/smartertravel/img/layout-6.png" alt="" />
		<img src="/smartertravel/img/layout-7.png" alt="" />
	</div>

	<p>
		After developing small scale models full scale models were developed so an accurate representation of the space was concluded.
	</p>
	<div class="third">
		<img src="/smartertravel/img/layout-8.png" alt="" />
		<img src="/smartertravel/img/layout-9.png" alt="" />
		<img src="/smartertravel/img/layout-10.png" alt="" />
	</div>

	<h3>Ergonomics</h3>
	<p>
		Ergonomic handles were made out of foam so that we could test if handles actually fit into people’s hands well and not just looking nice in sketches. These were developed by sanding down pieces of foam based on the sketches done in the ideation.
	</p>
	<div class="third">
		<img src="/smartertravel/img/ergono-1.png" alt="" />
		<img src="/smartertravel/img/ergono-2.png" alt="" />
		<img src="/smartertravel/img/ergono-3.png" alt="" />
		<img src="/smartertravel/img/ergono-4.png" alt="" />
	</div>

	<h2>Final System</h2>
	<p>
		Flow Charts were designed so that users can diagnose their own problems and stop people having waiting in line to have nothing wrong with their bikes. These would be displayed in the queue on walls.
	</p>
	<p>
		This is a similar flow to what the Bike Mechanic will go through when first getting the bike and doesn’t require the user to have much bike knowledge.
	</p>
	<img src="/smartertravel/img/flowchart.png" alt="" />
	<p>
		The Bike assistant could be a volunteer student who could get a reward for working. After the user comes to the front of the queue the assistant handles whether they need immediate attention or not. The bike is then placed on the rack and Gary is allowed to repair the bike and put it on the exit rack to allow for student pick up.
	</p>
	<img src="/smartertravel/img/sketch-21.jpeg" alt="" />
	<p>
		The final system incorporates layout of the gazebo has been changed around. The toolbox is now on the right of the mechanic and the bin is on the left. This layout is preferred if the Mechanic is right-handed and will be switched around for a left handed Mechanic. The bike stand stays in it’s current position and the storage boxes are behind him. This allows for very little back strainand allows the Mechanic to keep an eye on his toolbox. The Mechanic is also facing out towards the crowd so he can be a face for the brand.
	</p>
	<img src="/smartertravel/img/gazebo-2.png" alt="" />
	<p>
		The toolbox is coloured coded so that the Bike Mechanic can throw his tools into the box depending on the colour of the handle on the tool. This was designed this way because on watching the bike mechanic work he was always throwing tools back into the box and while it would be impossible to change this behaviour over night adjusting his toolbox to suit his own personal needs.

		</figure>
	</div>
	<p>
		Other things looked at during this final design stage were:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Pumps behind reception where users swap their student cards for pumps and get the card back once they return the pump.</li>
		<li>Cashbox for Gary</li>
		<li>More consice branding overall. Dropping the Bike Doctor, Smarter Travel and Gary Sheehan Bike Repair to one brand rather than 3.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		After meeting with Sean and Ross from Smarter Travel Limerick it was suggested that a poster that better advertised the Bike Workshop which is run by Smarter Travel be developed.
	</p>
	<p>
		This poster will be hung by the Bike Mechanic’s Gazebo because a core target market would be users of the Bike Mechanic.
