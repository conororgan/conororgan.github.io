    Making Movies

<p>From the TV shows we watch to the books we read to the products we use, everything we use has a story that it wants to tell. Your hard drive wants to tell you the story of how it will keep your data secure. Your phone wants to give the impression that it’s expensive and easy to use while your safe wants to give the impression its secure and no one will get inside.</p>

<p>Storytelling is as important in design as it is in Hollywood, every product needs a narrative to sell maybe even to make it onto market. This is why it is important for designers to learn about making stories.</p>

</p>Inspiration for creating a story can come from the smallest obstacle, for us it was hunger. After splitting into groups to go create a 30 second movie hunger took over us. We made our way up to Subway with a plan.</p>

<p>Once we got to Subway, Richie had a problem. He had no money, the look of disappointment in his eyes gave us the final idea. Our emotional journey to Subway was filmed by Eoghan and Will as Shane, Thomas, Richie and myself played characters in this film. </p>

<p>We filmed in 1 take and got to eat our Subway happy with our finished video, we headed back to the studio to get to editing. We tried editing on a phone but that didn’t work so we edited it on my laptop.</p>

<p>The longest part of this process was picking the music for our video because we only filmed 1 take. We chose “” by the Dropkick Murphy’s, “Turn Down for What” by DJ Snake and lil Jon and “bad Day” by Daniel Powter.</p>

<p>Overall the experience was positive and helped us all come up with ideas for our sizzle reels which are due in a couple of weeks.</p>
