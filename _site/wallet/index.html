		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>Wallet is a project that was given to me as part of my college course. The basis of the project was to design the functional object and packaging. The product could not be bigger than 50cm x 50cm x 50cm. The project required us to pick one of 5 themes:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Travel</li>
			<li>Play</li>
			<li>Leisure</li>
			<li>Learn</li>
			<li>Work</li>
		</ul>

		<p>The product must be built by the user and therefore be easy to put together and have simple instructions to accompany the packaging.</p>

		<p>The objectives for the project were:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Research an open-ended theme</li>
			<li>Explore materials and production methods</li>
			<li>Plan, specify and produce finished products</li>
			<li>Apply graphic design principles for effective visual communication</li>
			<li>Application of high level design skills</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Discover</h2>
		<p>The first part of the project was the discovery. This is were I fleshed out ideas to find an area that needs attention. This can be done in several ways the first step was a brainstorm.</p>

		<h3>Brainstorm</h3>

		<p>During this phase the themes were seperated out and split up so that different areas could be looked at.</p>

		<h3>Materials</h3>
		<p>The next stage of the process was to look at the different materials that can be laser cut. The laser cutter was the main manufacturing technique that was used for this project.</p>

		<h4>ABS</h4>
		<p>ABS or acrylonitrile butadiene styrene is a thermoplastic polymer. It is impact resistant and tough. Heating up gives off poisonous gases. It has a wide range of uses from Lego bricks to keyboard keycaps. Is not used very often for laser cutting.</p>

		<h4>Acrylic</h4>
		<p>Acrylic is a thermoplastic polymer. It is a stiff, fragile material comparable to glass. It retains laser cutting well and engraves well. Available in multiple colours. Cheapest plastic to laser cut.</p>

		<h4>Leather</h4>
		<p>Leather is a durable, flexible material created by tanning animal hide. It can tanned in a lot of different ways. These leave the leather with different properties. The most popular being chrome-tanned leather. It has a lot of different uses including shoes, hats, jackets, skirts, trousers and belts.</p>

		<h4>Laminate</h4>
		<p>Laminate is when several layers of a material are joined together to form a typically stronger material and other properties. Laminate materials can be anything from wood to plastic. There are a lot of uses for laminate including car windshields, flooring and paper.</p>

		<h3>Discover - Wallet</h3>
		<p>After looking at all these different areas that I could go into designing a wallet. I did this for a number of reasons.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Damaged Cards from wallet being too tight and not being designed properly</li>
			<li>Wallets being too big to fit in and out of pockets with ease. Especially skinny jeans.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>To design the wallet properly I looked at what is a wallet in a vaccum.</p>

		<h4>What makes a wallet a wallet?</h4>
		<p>The definition of a wallet is a pocket-sized folder for money and plastic cards. This can be done in multiple different materials from synthetic leather to real leather on to wood and acrylic. This definition allows for a bit of play with the design of a wallet. The description of the wallet as a “folder” is a loose one. Wallets come in all different shapes and sizes. </p>

		<h4>What are some recent advancements in wallets?</h4>
		<p>An important technology that is in current wallets is RFID blocking or Radio-Frequency Identification Blocking. RFID is the wireless use of electromagnetic fields to transfer data for the purpose of automatically identifying and tracking tags attached to objects. This is used in modern credit cards. Modern credit cards use this technology to charge a card when the card is placed on the right spot.</p>

		<p>Wallets can block these signals so that hackers can not use their phones to steal data off these cards, passports and other important cards.</p>

		<h4>How do you avoid demagnetising credit cards?</h4>
		<p>Avoiding demagnetising is important when using anything with a magnetic strip. This occurs when the black stripe on the back of the card becomes corrupted. This black stripe on the back of the cards is a magnetic strip. This strip is filled with data, which is arranged as magnetic particles and the basic properties of a magnetic mean these particles could get rearranged simply by being near a magnet.</p>

		<h3>Define</h3>
		<p>Defineing the style of product is an important step in any project, this process included creating mood boards.</p>

		<h4>Mood Boards</h4>
		<img src="/wallet/img/mood1.jpg" alt="Mood Board" />
		<img src="/wallet/img/mood2.jpg" alt="Mood Board" />

		<h2>Ideation</h2>
		<p>Ideation started with looking at different forms of wallets and different locking mechanisms that could be used to combine different layers of materials.</p>

		<p>The forms were explored in a number of different ways including holding card in place and displaying cards so it is easy to remove cards. A folder like wallet was also explored.</p>

		<img src="/wallet/img/ideation3.jpg" alt="Sketch Page"/>
		<img src="/wallet/img/ideation4.jpg" alt="Sketch Page"/>

		<h2>Concept Development</h2>
		<p>
			3 concepts were chosen to be developed into final designs. This included drawing Illustrator documents so that the laser cutting machine could be able to cut out the pieces.
		</p>

		<p>
			This concept has all the pieces laid out so I knew what to draw up in Illustrator. The drawings on the left is the final design for this concept.
		</p>
		<img src="/wallet/img/concept1.png" alt="Sketch Page" />

		<p>
			The second concept also had two final developments. The first had a piece of extra material that was used to tie the whole thing together. The second had these pieces of material already connected to the main body of the wallet.
		</p>
		<img src="/wallet/img/concept2.png" alt="Sketch Page" />

	 <p>
	 	The third concept shows just one final concept. This development uses 4 pieces of leatherette to hold the main body together. This concept required the most amount of pieces. This and the difficulty making on a laser cut made this concept unviable.
	 </p>

	 <img src="/wallet/img/concept3.png" alt="Sketch Page" />

	 <h3>Refinement</h3>
	 <p>A concept was made from leatherette on the laser cutter. This model was made to see the final model in the finished material. This model also allowed for some refinement before a final model could be made.</p>
	 <p>This model was too tight when made out of leatherette. The holes holding the material was also too big and allowed the joints to fall out of the material and pull the wallet apart when work was done.</p>

	 <h2>Branding</h2>
	 <p>
	 		After the wallet was designed branding was thought about. After thinking of several names and logo ideas. I decided that a simple name of just <i>“Wallet”</i> would be a good choice. This was chosen because of the large market while no single brand of wallet sticks out so people making internet searches will just search <i>“wallet”</i> and therefore will find this product. This name was accompanied by a logo. After researching and finding out more about different icons I thought of using <b>Braille</b> as the logo. <b>Braille</b> is a language used by blind people to read and write. This language is made up of number of dots, normally embossed so that the user can read by touch.
	 </p>

	 <img src="/wallet/img/branding.png" alt="Wallet Logo" />

	 <p>
	 	The colour scheme of the packaging was thought about. The colour scheme had to be both simple and eye-catching. The colour of orange is a very striking colour an catches the eye of the viewer. Especially when paired with contrasting greys and black. I also chose a lighter shade of orange to show off details.
	 </p>

	 <img src="/wallet/img/colour.png" alt="Wallet Colour Scheme" />

	 <p>
	 	The style of graphics on the packaging and throughout the project needs to consistent and not vary. I went to great lengths to make sure this was what happened when designing the graphics. After much experimentation I decided that a hard line outline will be around the outside of the graphics while details of the product is in a lighter line-weight.
		Examples of this are below:
	 </p>

	 <h2>Packaging and Instructions</h2>
	 <h3>Packaging</h3>
	 <p>
	 	The packaging for the product was printed out on paper and was improved over a number iterations. These iterations made the graphics and instructions clearer and easier to read. After a number of different versions a final design was picked.
	 </p>
	 <h4>Front Face</h4>
	 <p>
	 	The front face of the packaging features an eye-catching black bar across the front. This black bar gives some framing for both the logo and the tagline. After the user’s eye has been caught the eye is drawn to the view of the actual product. This allows the user have a clear and easy way to see what is inside the product. This image allows for the user to see the product both fully assembled.
	 </p>
	 <img src="/wallet/img/frontface.png" alt="Wallet Packaging Front Face" height="400" />

	 <h4>Back Face</h4>
	 <p>
	 	The back face of the packaging has the instruction blueprints for assembly. The contrasting front face of the product allows for the buyer to quickly assemble while still keeping the back simple and straight to the point.
	 </p>
	 <img src="/wallet/img/backface.png" alt="Wallet Packaging Back Face" height="400" />

	 <h2>Final Design</h2>
	 <p>
	 	The final design of the wallet is a leatherette package. It comes dissembled and can be built within a 1 minute. The whole design only has 1 piece and has a total assembled square millimetre footprint of under 600mm2. The whole dissembled footprint is 1700mm2. This allows for the wallet to fit easily into the users hand. The whole design is only the size of the cards you are holding so it can fit easily into the users pocket.
