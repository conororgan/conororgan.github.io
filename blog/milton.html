<article class="">

<p>Alex Milton is a designer who was born in London and has worked for companies such as General Motors on projects such as the Corvette. </p>

<p>His opening statement was “Research is at the heart of Design” about Design, as Design and through design. He thinks that everything we do as designers has to have research behind it from the inception of a project until the end. I agree with this statement because without research you could be making a project that doesn’t solve a need or isn’t designed for the people who would use it. </p>

<p>Alex Milton worked on cars because when he was going through college “cars were the most important cultural icon” he compared cars in the 70s as working for Apple in the 2010s, only the best designers work there. </p>

<blockquote>“Plywood is God’s Plastic”</blockquote>

<p>Alex described plywood as “God’s Plastic” because of how often he used it to create models of his designs. I don’t think plywood is used as often as he said anymore with the rise of rapid manufacturing like 3D printing. He used it mostly for Jubilee train line’s interiors. </p>

<p>After several years in the car industry he realised the car industry is very inward. All they do is grab inspiration from other cars and not products from outside the car world. </p>

<p>Another thing Alex said was designers have continuously develop skills or become redundant as a designer. I agree with this statement, in every profession you have to continue to develop or you will be left behind by your competition. This happens in music as well when an artist finds mainstream success and never changes their act so they never become as successful again.</p>
