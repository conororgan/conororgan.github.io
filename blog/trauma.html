    <p>Sometimes Trauma can lead to a complete blackout of memories and other times can lead to the memory taking over your life, which leads to Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. This is what the basis of an exhibit in the Science Gallery in Dublin. This exhibit shows how trauma affects people in different ways and how products can be made to both show how people with injuries and illnesses work and how they are overcome.</p>

    <p>An interesting sculpture was a glove like structure that mimics the sensation of having Arthritis, called “GRASP” and made by Colm McNally. Arthritis is a common illness that causes the inflammation of both the skin and joints, this makes it difficult to control the joints and makes it seem like the limbs have a mind of their own. While wearing this glove you had to both pick up a tea pot and undo and redo lids on a number of pots. This turned out to be much more difficult than it seemed at first! This exhibit would allow designers to experience what it’s like to suffer from arthritis and design things to fight or improve the life of sufferers.</p>

    <p>Another interesting exhibit was a product called “XSTAT / PARABELT”. Hemorrhage is the leading cause of death in and around a battlefield. This is due to the amount and severity of injuries and the lack of access to the medical equipment. The XSTAT is trying to fix that, It is a syringe like system that injects pellets made of cellulose into a wound. These than expand and try to stop the bleeding and help decrease the number of deaths around a battlefield.</p>

    <p>As well as visiting the Trauma exhibit we visited the IBM design studios situated outside Dublin City. IBM has a long history of designers working for them including Paul Rand who designed their current logo. While this design history was lost throughout the 1990s and 2000s, a change of pace has made IBM start to focus on design again in recent years.</p>

    <p>The studio in Dublin was opened a little under 2 years ago and is one of the main IBM design studios in the world. After arriving at the facilities we were brought up stairs and we were allowed look around at the numerous glass boards around the room. These boards were used for collaboration along with other things. These helped the designers work to together to quickly generate ideas and to rule out bad directions. They would be helpful in any studio in the world.</p>

    <p>I would consider this trip to be a successful trip and I think we all learned a lot.</p>
