    <span class='fadeIn animated'><p>Expanding your horizons is important as a designer from both a creative and a world perspective point of view. Meeting new people and doing new things are stimulants for creative thinking. Seeing new things and meeting new people allow designers to see new problems which they wouldn’t have thought about before. This is benefits both the designer and the world if the problem is solved.</p>

<p>While meeting new people is important for designers. Remembering where you come from is also important so you grasp and seize where you are going. As the famous idiom goes “Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me”. Mistakes will always be made but learning from them both improves you, as a person and you as a designer.</p>

<p>While these things are important, focusing on things that you see everyday and finding things that you won’t normally see. This can be made easier by cutting a square out of a piece paper and looking through it. This allows the person viewing to see a smaller viewpoint and can focus on things that you wouldn’t always see.</p>

<blockquote>Enlarge Our Souls, Light Up our Brains, Liberate our spirits - Tom Robbins</blockquote>

<p>Another thing that can be done to improve creativity is going on a “spiritual journey”. This Spiritual Journey can be done by walking somewhere you don’t normally go and watching and listening to every thing you can hear. This can be a simple as hearing the birds sing when you normally walk past. For my spiritual journey I went to the Living Bridge in UL. Here I stopped and looked at the river flowing past and the birds chirping. Along with these I noticed how much the bridge actually moves which you don’t notice if you are just walking across it. The movement is nearly nauseating.</p>

<p>Another way to be more creative is to carry a notebook and sketch and take notes on everything you see that interests you. This can be the way a tree is blowing in the wind to a piece of rubbish which caught your eye. Writing or sketching these will allow you to remember what you saw and how it generated ideas in your head later on.</p>

<p>A final way to be more creative is allow a break between each creative session. This can be a nap or even a meal. This allows you to come back fresh and with new ideas.</p></span>
