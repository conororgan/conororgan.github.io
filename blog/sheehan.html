<p>Peter Sheehan is a graduate of the NCAD in Dublin. He has worked for Black Box Design and Design Partners which have had clients such as Logitech. He currently works at his own company, Peter Sheehan Studio. He gave a talk on what he thinks design is about and how to draw inspiration. </p>

<blockquote>“Prototype and Model”</blockquote>

<p>Peter Sheehan started his talk with a comment about how you have to prototype and model to produce a good product. You must go through iterations upon iterations to get the desired work.
I agree with this point, nothing is ever perfect the first time you do it and needs to be done a number of times to improve and make the best thing you can make.</p>

<p>Peter’s main point was about designers needing to take inspiration from artists to improve their thinking out side the box. I also agree with this statement, artists like Grayson Perry and Jean-Michel Basquiat think outside the box to show either a political opinion or for the viewer to come to life.</p>

<p>As a workshop Peter made us do a quick 2 hour project. The brief, “Design a tablet stand which can hold a tablet and change to different angles”. Peter first showed us how he works through a brief like this and then sent us off. Let he tell you it was an intense 2 hours! Knifes were getting shared, paper was getting sliced, pencils were flying everywhere. </p>

<p>After a quick 2 hours our time was up, we had to show Peter what we had done. He picked out a couple of people’s work and showed them to the class.</p>

<p>I believe this experience taught us a lot and really helped us gain skills in what we need in the future. </p>
