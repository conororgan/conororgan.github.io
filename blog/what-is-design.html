    What the Hell is Product Design?

  <p>Whenever I meet someone new they always ask what course I am studying, after I tell them I am studying Product Design nine times out of ten they will reply with “What is that?”. This is in itself is a tricky question to answer.</p>

<p>I think it is important to see what other designers think and then form your own opinion after they give you new insights into what other people think. This requires research just like all of a Product Designers projects Yves Behar, founder of the Fuseproject and Chief Creative Officer for Jawbone describes Product Design as a way to “accelerate the adoption of new ideas” while Harvey Mascot, owner of Mascot Eyewear describes good design as “design that transcends trends”. Jony Ive, Chief Design Officer for Apple has been quoted saying “Design is a word that’s come to mean so much that it’s also a word that has come to mean nothing”.</p>

<blockquote>“Design is a word that’s come to mean so much that it’s also a word that has come to mean nothing”</blockquote>

<p>Jony Ive’s opinion is rather interesting because with the amount of scope in design, from industrial, interaction, user experience to graphic design the word is nearly becoming too saturated and is becoming like the word art. The word art has come to describe anything that people create that doesn’t really have a perfect descriptor. A quick google search of the word art brings up paintings by Van Gogh and Leonardo da Vinci to birds cut out of paper to pictures of lights on a screen. All these things are complete opposites to each other and should probably use a more suitable descriptor than just “art”.</p>

<p>Another word you need to look at when describe Product Design is “Product”. What is it are we actually designing? Aura Oslapas, founder of A + O, says “The meaning of the word hasn’t changed but what it encompasses has expanded”. This is an interesting point of view from someone who has experience in both retail and the design of products having worked as Senior Vice President at Best Buy. She goes on to say “That product can be physical as in a toaster or soft as in an app and a product can be a service like a bank”. This quote shows the wide range of services and tasks that a “Product” can be.</p>

<blockquote>“That product can be physical as in a toaster or soft as in an app and a product can be a service like a bank”</blockquote>

<p>Now for my own opinion after researching the topic. I personally feel like Product Design is the Design of anything a person may interact with during they’re daily run abouts. This makes a Product Designer a person who is very important to smooth running of society and makes everyone’s lives a better place.</p>
